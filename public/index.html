    <p>Super Duper Burger is&hellip;fine. The burgers always look good, sometimes they even taste good. But sometimes they don&rsquo;t. Better than Locol though.
Somewhat like Locol, Super Duper Burger advocates for change through conscious eating, however, they don&rsquo;t beat you over the head with it, and they don&rsquo;t try and act like a hamburger should be considered a health food or a driver of social activism. They just think that food shouldn&rsquo;t be garbage.</p>

    <p>Rather than give each burger a score out of 5 or 10, I am going to rank the burger on an absolute scale as compared to the other burgers that have been reviewed. For example, Locol being my first review, get&rsquo;s a 1. If another burger comes along and outperforms Locol, then that burger get&rsquo;s the 1 spot, and Locol moves to 2, and so on.

  <article>
    <p>On January 3rd, 2017 Locol, the small time burger chain with Michelin pedigree and a social cause, was skewered by the New York Times. This has caused quite a stir in the world of&hellip;people who review cheap food. Fortunately for me, I am now one of those people, and Locol Oakland - the same location reviewed by NYT food critic Pete Wells - is only blocks from my office. So on a stormy Wednesday night, my partner and I headed over to see what the hell was going on.</p>

    <p>The point of this blog is to post every time I have a burger. Sometimes there will be pictures, sometimes not. Sometimes I might feel inspired to write about the experience, most of the time not.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m not a food writer. I won&rsquo;t (and I can&rsquo;t) write like one. I am also not a food photographer. I won&rsquo;t (and I can&rsquo;t) take nice pictures of the crap I eat.</p>
