Rather than give each burger a score out of 5 or 10, I am going to rank the burger on an absolute scale as compared to the other burgers that have been reviewed. For example, Locol being my first review, get's a 1. If another burger comes along and outperforms Locol, then that burger get's the 1 spot, and Locol moves to 2, and so on. I will keep a .csv with the most up-to-date details in the [github repo](https://github.com/ben-e/bensburgerblog) housing this blog.  

Onward.
