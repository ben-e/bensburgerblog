[Super Duper Burger](http://superduperburgers.com/) is...fine. The burgers always look good, sometimes they even taste good. But sometimes they don't. Better than Locol though.

----------------

Somewhat like [Locol](http://www.welocol.com/), Super Duper Burger advocates for change through conscious eating, however, they don't beat you over the head with it, and they don't try and act like a hamburger should be considered a health food or a driver of social activism. They just think that food shouldn't be garbage.

----------------

The pickles are good too.
